# Motivation
Most, people use Excel for tracking thier job application, but I on the other hand decided to use Google Docs. Looking back, I probably should’ve used Excel too... but oh well, it is what it is.

Trying to keep track of everything in Docs was pretty tough, and at the time I didn’t have many personal projects to show. So I thought, why not make a simple Job Tracker!? And well, thats exactly what I did.
Now, it took me longer than expected to finish, but one of my goals (and something a recruiter also recommended) was to stay consistent — to try and do a little something each day.

Also, since I learned full-stack development at uni using .NET and C#, I figured this would be a good chance to dive deeper into it.

Welp, that's the gist of it :)
